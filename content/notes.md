**Keywords:** ```Cosmology``` ```Inflation``` ```Perturbative theory``` ```Cosmic Microwave Background```

*The Early Universe* **PHYS 40772** is a lecture course taught at the University of Manchester for the degree of Master in Physics and Astrophysics. It is a level-4 course, which follows up from the **PHYS 40771** course on *Gravitation* and the *General Theory of Relativity*.
These are the sets of notes I have taken during the semester (Jan - May 2019), with later typesetting and content edits.
