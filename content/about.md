### Introduction

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Astrophysics and Cosmology, based at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA) and affiliated to the University of Manchester. My main areas of research revolve around galaxy clusters, cosmological simulations with supercomputers and large scale structures in the Universe.

In 2019, I graduated with a Master Degree from the University of Manchester with the thesis "Substructures in galaxy clusters: observability study using the MACSIS hydrodynamical simulation and Sunyaev-Zel’dovich signals". This work, carried out in collaboration with my project partner Martin Murin and my supervisor Dr. Scott Kay, still constitutes an important part of my Ph.D. studies.

My interests span beyond the involvement with scientific research. I particularly enjoy communicating science to the wider public through outreach events, as well as teaching and supervising younger Physics and Astronomy students through different stages of their education. I am a member of the University of Manchester Astronomy Society, which I joined near the beginning of my studies in Manchester and I have been actively supporting ever since. I also demonstrate experiments in Undergraduate Laboratory courses and supervise practical sessions for Python and C++ Object-Oriented Programming courses.

### Biography

I was born in 1996 and raised in a small town in Central Italy, where I also attended the local Scientific High School.

Soon after the beginning of my studies I started attending public stargazings, hosted at P. F. de Vico astronomical observatory, managed by the Crabnebula astronomy society. I can safely state that this is how all my interest in Astronomy, Physics and science in general begun. Soon after I embarked on the route of the Italian Astronomy Olympiads (years 2011 - 2014) and the International Astronomy Olympiads (Almaty, Kazakhstan 2011  & Vilnius, Lithuania 2013).

Roughly simultaneously to the Astronomy Olympiads, I also developed a strong passion for the most "hands-on" aspects of Astronomy and I decided to invest in the first proper telescope and camera setups: Celestron Starbright C9.25, Skywatcher NEQ6 and a Canon EOS 1100D. Despite the setup not being optimised for long exposures on very faint celestial objects, I managed to observe and capture several nebulae and star clusters, with several exceptional views on the moon and planets during nights with good seeing. In the early lights of the 6th June 2012 I luckily finished building a mylar-based solar filter, just in time for Venus's transit in front of the sun. Luckily, the sky was partially clear towards the East and together with the Crabnebula society members we managed to observe the sun rising with Venus just about to begin its dance.

Several more special events brightened up my experience with many new incredible friends, fellow astronomy enthusiasts and even professionals, encouraging me to start a Master degree in Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Manchester. At the time of writing I am about to start the final year of my degree, which already introduced me to a wide spectrum of areas of science, interacting together in a truly fascinating way. The purpose of this website is to share the network of ideas that I encounter every day, giving a taste of my routine and my learning experience. I will try to include contents appropriate for the widest range of backgrounds, although many details might fall on the technical side.

As mentioned, such website itself is part of my learning experience and therefore it is conceived as a work in progress, subject to continuous editing and maximally open to any feedback that you may provide.

With all said, I wish you a pleasant read.
