### [Substructures in galaxy clusters | Master thesis] ({{< ref "/projects_repo/macsis.md" >}})
##### _Observability study using the MACSIS hydrodynamical simulation and Sunyaev-Zel’dovich signals_

##### **Abstract:**
In the Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology, galaxy clusters are the latest objects to have formed in a process known
as hierarchical structure formation. As a result, clusters should retain some memory of smaller
objects (galaxy groups, or sub-halos) that have merged over the past few billion years, leading
to a complex internal substructure. Identifying cluster substructure with multi-wavelength techniques is currently an extremely active observational area, which aims at studying the dynamic
environment of the largest objects in the Universe. In this work, we use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations to model massive galaxy clusters, study their hot ionised gas and map
their shadow projected from the Cosmic Microwave Background. This phenomenon, known as
the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect, is the main focus of our project and provides us with information
about the thermodynamics and bulk motion of the hot gas in clusters. In my presentation, I will
briefly touch upon the astrophysics of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect, explaining its importance in
the context of galaxy clusters research. I will then draw the attention to the most recent results of
our project, including mock observation from hydrodynamical simulations, substructure detection
algorithms and the impact of our findings on next-generation observations in microwave bands.

Left: visualisation of the gas distribution in largest MACSIS halo and the surrounding cosmic web filaments at redshift
$z$ = 0.57, populated with smaller halos. The colour coding expresses the density of the gas, ranging from blue (diffuse) to red
(dense). Right: schematic relative to the figure on the
left, highlighting the predominant halos and their infall towards the cluster. The IGM associated with the main halo is known as
ICM and is marked by the central black circle, while the IGM associated with smaller objects is marked in red. The figure also
displays the diffuse IGM arranged along the filaments of the cosmic web. Image and animation created using the ```glnemo``` software
and PGF/```Tikz``` modules.
